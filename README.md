So after looking through code for an hour, I found why it would not initially start the install process, you were missing an ' after the color code in the first view.

After that, it was smooth sailing. The main issue that I encountered was changing the orientation of the emulator, it caused some of the wording and labels to start overlapping one another and having to scroll through the contact info table.  The best solution that I see for this is to simply play around with your percentages a little more, maybe reduce the size of the picture to allow for that space to be used elsewhere.

The other big thing that I noticed was that on your child page the color of the text was not changed or set to something more readable, it was extremely difficult to make out what was on that page.

Running the app on a tablet emulator it started causing far to much blank space, which I ran into with my own code, I would recommend playing with the percentages a bit more or look and see if you can find anything on master views online, there is a section in the book, but looking at it for myself, I found it slightly confusing.
